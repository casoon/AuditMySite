**Type**: Patch Release (Bug Fixes)

## 🚀 What's New

Version 1.8.5 focuses on fixing critical issues in the HTML accessibility reports that were affecting the accuracy and usability of the generated reports.

## 🐛 Critical Fixes

### HTML Report Issues Resolved

1. **✅ Fixed Total Errors Calculation**
   - **Issue**: Total errors showing 0 even when individual pages had accessibility errors
   - **Fix**: Added intelligent fallback calculation that sums errors from individual pages when summary data is incomplete
   - **Impact**: Reports now show accurate error counts

2. **✅ Fixed Test Duration Display**
   - **Issue**: Test duration always showing 0ms instead of actual runtime
   - **Fix**: Implemented fallback duration calculation using individual page load times
   - **Impact**: Users can now see actual test execution times

3. **✅ Fixed Pa11y Score Display**
   - **Issue**: Pa11y accessibility scores showing as "N/A" or undefined in tables
   - **Fix**: Enhanced data source detection with proper score formatting (e.g., "85/100")
   - **Impact**: Accessibility scores are now properly displayed and formatted

### UI/UX Improvements

4. **✅ Removed Duplicate Headings**
   - **Issue**: Performance section had duplicate `<h2>` headers causing layout confusion
   - **Fix**: Refactored all report sections to use consistent table-based structure
   - **Impact**: Clean, professional report layout

5. **✅ Professional Branding**
   - **Issue**: Inconsistent "auditmysite" text branding and emoji icons
   - **Fix**: 
     - Replaced text logo with professional SVG checkmark design
     - Updated branding to consistent "AuditMySite" format
     - Removed all emoji icons for professional appearance
   - **Impact**: Clean, corporate-ready report design

6. **✅ Improved Filter Layout**
   - **Issue**: Filter buttons misplaced in header navigation
   - **Fix**: Moved filter badges to dedicated section below header with better styling
   - **Impact**: Improved navigation and visual hierarchy
