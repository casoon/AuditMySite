# ✅ Advanced ARIA impact scoring  
# ✅ Chrome 135 performance optimizations
# ✅ Semantic quality evaluation
# ✅ Future readiness assessment
```

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Q: Chrome 135 features not detected?**
A: Update to Chrome 135+ or use `--expert` mode to disable Chrome-specific features.

**Q: HTML5 analysis showing low scores?**  
A: Focus on adding semantic elements like `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, proper `<summary>` text.

**Q: ARIA critical issues found?**
A: Check for missing `aria-labelledby` references and invalid ARIA attribute values.

**Q: Future readiness score low?**
A: Adopt modern HTML5 elements, update ARIA patterns, optimize Core Web Vitals.

### Performance Tips:
- Use `--expert` mode to disable features you don't need
- Test fewer pages initially with `auditmysite url` (defaults to 5)
- Increase concurrent tests for faster execution
- Use `--non-interactive` for automated testing
